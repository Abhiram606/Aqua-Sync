# Aqua-Sync
AquaBot addresses the growing need for efficient plant care solutions in modern agriculture and urban gardening. Traditional watering methods often lead to overwatering or underwatering, resulting in wasted water and suboptimal plant health. AquaBot solves these challenges by automating the watering process based on real-time soil moisture data. This innovative system ensures healthier plant growth, reduces water wastage, and simplifies plant care. 

## Components Used in AquaBot:

1. **Microcontroller:** Manages the overall system operation and interfaces with sensors and actuators.
2. **Soil Moisture Sensor:** Measures soil moisture levels to determine watering requirements.
3. **Water Pump:** Dispenses water to plants based on sensor data and user-defined settings.
4. **Relay module:**  acts as a switch that controls the  activation and deactivation of water pump.
5. **Power Supply:** A 9V battery or alternative power source is used to supply power to Arduino and other components.
6. **Pipe:** A connected system for transporting water from pump to plants.
